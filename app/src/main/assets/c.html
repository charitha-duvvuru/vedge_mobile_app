    <p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>1.What is C Language?</strong></h3>
<p>C programming language, the pioneer of programming languages, is a procedural programming language. Dennis Ritchie created it as a system programming language for writing operating systems. It is one of the most popular programming languages because of its structure, high-level abstraction, machine-independent feature, etc. and is a great starting point for anyone wanting to get into coding.&nbsp;</p>
<p>C is also used a lot in low-level system programming, embedded systems, and hardware. It has also been heavily optimized over the years and is still used to write sophisticated software such as the FreeBSD operating system and the XNU kernel. Low-level memory access, a small collection of keywords, and a clean style are all qualities that make the C language excellent for system programming&rsquo;s, such as<span style="color: #000000;">&nbsp;<a style="color: #000000;" href="https://www.interviewbit.com/operating-system-interview-questions/"><strong>operating system</strong></a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a style="color: #000000;" href="https://www.interviewbit.com/online-c-compiler/"><strong>compiler development</strong></a>.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>C is a low-level programming language that can be directly interfaced with the processor. It offers minimal abstraction and maximal control, making it an attractive option for developers who want to write efficient code.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<h3><strong>2.Why is C called a mid-level programming language?</strong></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>C has characteristics of both assembly-level i.e. low-level and higher-level languages. So as a result, C is commonly called a middle-level language. Using C, a user can write an operating system as well as create a menu-driven consumer billing system.</p>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<h3><strong>3.What are the features of the C language?</strong></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some features of the C language are-&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
    <li>It is Simple And Efficient.&nbsp;</li>
    <li>C language is portable or Machine Independent.</li>
    <li>C is a mid-level Programming Language.&nbsp;</li>
    <li>It is a structured Programming Language.</li>
    <li>It has a function-rich library.&nbsp;</li>
    <li>Dynamic Memory Management.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<h3><strong>4.What is a token?</strong></h3>
<p>The individual elements of a program are called Tokens. There are following 6 types of tokens are available in C:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Identifiers</li>
    <li>Keywords</li>
    <li>Constants</li>
    <li>Operators</li>
    <li>Special Characters</li>
    <li>Strings</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>5. <strong>What is the use of printf() and scanf() functions? Also explain format specifiers?</strong></h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>printf()</strong>&nbsp;is used to print the output on the display.</li>
    <li><strong>scanf()</strong>&nbsp;is used to read formatted data from the keyboard.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>Some datatype format specifiers for both printing and scanning purposes are as follows:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>%d</strong>: It's a datatype format specifier for printing and scanning an integer value.&nbsp;</li>
    <li><strong>%s</strong>: It's a datatype format specifier for printing and scanning a string.&nbsp;</li>
    <li><strong>%c</strong>: It's a datatype format specifier for displaying and scanning a character value.</li>
    <li><strong>%f</strong>: The datatype format specifier %f is used to display and scan a float value</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>6.What's the value of the expression 5["abxdef"]?</strong></h3>
<p>The answer is&nbsp;<strong>'f'.</strong></p>
<p>Explanation: The string mentioned "abxdef" is an array, and the &nbsp;expression is equal to "abxdef"[5]. Why is the inside-out expression equivalent? &nbsp;Because a[b] is equivalent to *(a + b) which is equivalent to *(b + a) which is equivalent to b[a].</p>
<h3><strong>7.What is a built-in function in C?</strong></h3>
<p>The most commonly used built-in functions in C are scanf(), printf(), strcpy, strlwr, strcmp, strlen, strcat, and many more.</p>
<p>Built-function is also known as library functions that are provided by the system to make the life of a developer easy by assisting them to do certain commonly used predefined tasks. For example, if you need to print output or your program into the terminal, we use printf() in C.</p>
<h3><strong>8.What is a Preprocessor?</strong></h3>
<p>A preprocessor is a software program that processes a source file before sending it to be compiled. Inclusion of header files, macro expansions, conditional compilation, and line control are all possible with the preprocessor.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<h3><strong>9.What is recursion in C?</strong></h3>
<p>When a function in C calls a copy of itself, this is known as recursion. To put it another way, when a function calls itself, this technique is called Recursion. Also, this function is known as recursive function.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>10.What is a pointer in C?</strong></h3>
<p>A pointer is a variable that stores or points to another variable's address. The value of a variable is stored in a normal variable, whereas the address of a variable is stored in a pointer variable.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<h3><strong>11.Difference between const char* p and char const* p?</strong></h3>
<ul>
    <li>const char* p is a pointer to a const char.</li>
    <li>char const* p is a pointer to a char const.</li>
</ul>
<p>Since const char and char const are the same, it's the same.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>12.What is pointer to pointer in C?</strong></h3>
<p>In C, a pointer can also be used to store the address of another pointer. A double pointer or pointer to pointer is such a pointer. The address of a variable is stored in the first pointer, whereas the address of the first pointer is stored in the second pointer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>13.Why n++ executes faster than n+1 ?</strong></h3>
<p>n++ being a unary operation, it just needs one variable. Whereas, n = n + 1 is a binary operation that adds overhead to take more time (also binary operation: n += 1). However, in modern platforms, it depends on few things such as processor architecture, C compiler, usage in your code, and other factors such as hardware problems.</p>
