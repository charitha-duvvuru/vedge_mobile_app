        <li><strong>Concept of Percentage:</strong></li>
    </ol>
    <p>By a certain percent, we mean that may hundredths.</p>
    <p>Thus, x percent means x hundredths, written as x %.</p>
    <p>To express x% as a fraction: We have, x % = x/100.</p>
    <p>Thus &nbsp;20% = 20/100 = 1/5.</p>
    <p>To express a/b as a percent: We have, a/b = ((a/b)x100) %</p>
    <p>Thus , &frac14; = ((1/4)x100)% = 25%</p>

        <li><strong>Percentage Increase/Decrease:</strong></li>
    </ol>
    <p>If the price of a commodity increases by R %, then the reduction in consumption so as not to increase the expenditure is :</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>(R/(100+R) x100) %</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>If the price of a commodity decreases by R%, then the increase in consumption so as not to decrease the expenditure is:</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>((R/(100-R)x100)%</p>

        <li><strong>Results on population:</strong></li>

    <p>Let the population of a town be P now and suppose it increases at the rate of R% per annum,</p>
    <p>Then:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Population after n years = p (1+(R/100))^n</li>

    <p>Let the present value of a machine be P. Suppose it depreciates at the rate of R% per annum. Then:</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Value of the machine after n years = p(1-(R/100))^n</li>
        <li>Value of the machine n years ago = p/(1-R/100))^n</li>
        <li>If A is R% more than B , then B is less than A by ((R/(100+R) X100))%</li>
