    <p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>Cost Price:</strong></p>
    <p>The price, at which an article is purchased, is called its&nbsp;<em class="ga-def">cost price</em>, abbreviated as&nbsp;<em class="ga-def">C.P.</em></p>
    <p><strong>Selling Price:</strong></p>
    <p>The price, at which an article is sold, is called its&nbsp;<em class="ga-def">selling prices</em>, abbreviated as&nbsp;<em class="ga-def">S.P.</em></p>
    <p><strong>Profit or Gain:</strong></p>
    <p>If S.P. is greater than C.P., the seller is said to have a&nbsp;<em class="ga-def">profit</em>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<em class="ga-def">gain</em>.</p>
    <p><strong>Loss:</strong></p>
    <p>If S.P. is less than C.P., the seller is said to have incurred a&nbsp;<em class="ga-def">loss</em>.</p>
    <p><strong>IMPORTANT FORMULAE</strong></p>
    <p>1.Gain = (S.P.) - (C.P.)</p>
    <p>2.Loss = (C.P.) - (S.P.)</p>
    <p>3.Loss or gain is always reckoned on C.P.</p>
    <p>4.Gain Percentage: Gain % = ([Gain x 100] / C.P)</p>
    <p>5.Loss Percentage: Loss %=([Loss x 100]/ C.P)</p>
    <p>6.Selling Price: SP=([100 + Gain % ] / 100) x C.P</p>
    <p>7.Selling Price: SP=([100 - Loss % ] /100) x C.P</p>
    <p>8.Cost Price: C.P = ([ 100/(100 +Gain %) ] xS.P )</p>
    <p>9.Cost Price: C.P = (100 / [100 - Loss %] ) x S.P</p>
    <p>10.If an article is sold at a gain of say 35%, then S.P. = 135% of C.P. </p>
    <p>11.If an article is sold at a loss of say, 35% then S.P. = 65% of C.P.</p>
    <p>12.When a person sells two similar items, one at a gain of say&nbsp;<em class="ga-var">x</em>%, and the other at a loss of&nbsp;<em class="ga-var">x</em>%, then the seller always incurs a loss given by:</p>
    <p>Loss % =( Common Loss and Gain % /100) x 2 = (x/10) x 2</p>
    <p>14.If a trader professes to sell his goods at cost price, but uses false weights, then</p>
    <p>Gain % = (Error / [True value -Error]) x 100 %</p>
