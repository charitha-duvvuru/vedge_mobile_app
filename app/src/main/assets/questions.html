<p><span style="color: #000000;">There are a few things that make me different from other candidates. First, I have a lot of experience working with different teams and managing projects. I&rsquo;m also great at communicating with people, so I can easily build relationships with clients and coworkers. Finally, I have a strong interest in learning new things and taking on new challenges.</span></p>
<ol start="4">
    <li><span style="color: #000000;"><strong><strong> Tell me about a time when you were not satisfied with your performance?</strong></strong></span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">There are a few reasons why interviewers might ask this question. One possibility is that the interviewer wants to understand if you can take feedback and improve upon your weaknesses.

<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong><strong>Sample Answer:&nbsp;</strong></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">I was not satisfied with my performance when assigned to lead a project and failed to meet the deadline. I felt like I let my team down and was very disappointed.

</ol>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The interviewer wants to know how you handle difficult situations. They are looking for a pattern of behavior, so they want to know about a time when you had difficulty with a project. They will also want to see how you combated that situation and what you learned from the experience.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong><strong>Sample Answer:</strong></strong>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The most difficult project I ever worked on was a website redevelopment project. The client had very specific and detailed requirements, and they were constantly changing their mind about what they wanted. This caused a lot of reworking, and it wasn't easy to keep the project on track. In the end, the client was happy with the final product, but it was a very stressful experience.</span></p>
